        Using the provided (paginated) API, find the average cubic weight for all products in the "Air Conditioners" category.
        
        Cubic weight is calculated by multiplying the length, height and width of the parcel. The result is then multiplied by the industry standard cubic weight conversion factor of 250.

        Cubic Weight Example
        A parcel measuring 40cm long (0.4m) x 20cm high (0.2m) x 30cm wide (0.3m) is equal to 0.024 cubic metres.
        Multiplied by the conversion factor of 250 gives a cubic weight of 6kg.
        
         0.4m x 0.2m x 0.3m = 0.024m3
        0.024m3 x 250 = 6kg
        Assume that
        All dimensions are provided in centimetres.
        All weights are provided in grams.
